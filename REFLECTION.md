What patterns or surprises did you notice?
A key pattern I noticed was the idea of composition. The `isOdd` function, for example, didn't need to reinvent the wheel.
It simply reused the logic from `isEven` and inverted the result. This is a powerful concept because it reduces code duplication and makes the system easier to maintain.
If I ever found a better way to check for even numbers, I would only need to update one function, and `isOdd` would automatically benefit.
The `sum` function also showed the power of built-in array methods like `.reduce()`, which provides a clean and declarative way to perform a calculation on a list of items.

What logic challenged your thinking?
The logic for the `sum` function was a bit more challenging than the others.
Initially, I might have reached for a `for` loop, but I wanted to use a more modern, functional approach.
Understanding how `reduce` works, with its accumulator and current value, took a moment of thought.
I also realized I needed to add error handling. What if someone passed a string or a number instead of an array?
Adding the `Array.isArray()` check made the function more robust and reliable, which is a crucial consideration when building a reusable toolkit.

How might this kind of toolkit be used in the real world?
A math toolkit like this is incredibly practical. While these functions are simple, they are the building blocks for more complex operations.

- Data Analysis: Calculating sums, averages, or other statistics on datasets.

- Financial Applications: A banking app might use these functions for calculating interest, transaction totals, or validating account numbers.

- Game Development: Game logic often relies heavily on math for things like calculating scores (`sum`, `multiply`), determining game states (`isEven` for turn-taking), or physics calculations.

- Web Development: A shopping cart would use the `sum` function to calculate the total price of all items.

Building this toolkit demonstrates that even the most complex software is often built from small, well-defined, and reusable functions.
